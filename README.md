e. What is the difference between git and GitHub?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously, keeps track of every change, and enables users to revert to previous versions of the code.

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It adds additional functionality on top of Git, such as collaboration features, issue tracking, code review tools (pull requests), and more. GitHub acts as a central repository where developers can store their projects, collaborate with others, and manage development workflows.


f. What does git diff do?

The git diff command shows the differences between various Git data sources. It can be used to see what changes have been made to files in your working directory compared to the last commit.

g. What is the main branch?

The main branch (previously called master) is the default and primary branch in a Git repository where the production-ready code is stored. It's the branch that usually reflects the latest stable release of the project. Changes are merged into the main branch after they've been reviewed and tested in other branches (such as feature or development branches).

h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?

No, it is generally not recommended to directly push changes into the main branch after the initial commit, especially in collaborative projects.
